# Aeries Tools
Interesting added functionality for Aeries using aeries-api

## TODO
- calculate category points independently (to avoid roundoff)
- set a reasonable cost for extra credit assignments

## Ideas:
- calculate a grade needed on an assignment to give an overall total grade
	- now possible with aeries-api giving gradebook details
	- currently being worked on as OptimalGrades.py
- do a better job a predicting grade trends
- something really, really cool, that we haven't thought of yet
